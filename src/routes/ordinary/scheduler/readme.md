# Scheduler Algorithm

for each product

Fill day first because it's most limited

Iterate over items until you have a routine filled and can't add any more items without conflicts or adding more than 3 serums

Then start a new routine

Keep iterating until you've used ALL products at least once



If all routines are day, you can copy the day routine to the night routine because day routines can be night routine
